# QFN48-nRF52811-Bluetooth-5.1-KiCad and Altium

The original schematic and files were designed and downloaded as Altium designer files. Afte they were edited to make the dev board, this repo was used: https://github.com/thesourcerer8/altium2kicad to convert the altium designer files from altium to KiCad. Then, these files still neded editing in KiCad, eventyally leading to the filal KiCad file. It is reccomended to use the Altium files if you intend to print of use the board, since they are original and not converted. I would be more than happy if anyone checked the KiCad files and aproved their functionality, or design the board from the beggining for KiCad.
